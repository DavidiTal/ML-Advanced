ML Project - Road Accident Analysis

Project Description

This project analyzes a dataset of road accidents to identify trends and derive insights. The process includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis. It focuses on handling missing values, filtering relevant data, and preparing it for further machine learning or statistical modeling.

Features

Data Loading: Reads a CSV file containing road accident data.

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and ensures data consistency.

Exploratory Analysis: Provides insights into the structure and quality of the data.

Customizable Filtering: Allows filtering data for specific years or conditions.

Dataset

Source: "דאטה תאונות דרכים.csv"

Focus: Data from 2022 and later.

Encoding: cp1255

Steps

Preprocessing: Load and inspect the data.

Cleaning: Remove columns with over 50% missing values (except critical columns like RAMZOR), handle rows with minor missing data, and drop duplicates.

Exploratory Analysis: Summarize data shape, types, and completeness.

Preparation: Prepare data for modeling.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
